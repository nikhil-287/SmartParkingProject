# Components Directory

This directory contains reusable React components used throughout the application.

## Structure

- Each component should be in its own file or folder (for complex components)
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Include PropTypes or TypeScript types for better type safety

## Example

```
components/
  ├── Button/
  │   ├── Button.js
  │   ├── Button.styles.js
  │   └── index.js
  └── Card.js
```
