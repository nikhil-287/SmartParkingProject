# Navigation Directory

This directory contains navigation configuration and setup.

## Usage

When you're ready to add navigation, install React Navigation:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```

Then create your navigation structure here.
